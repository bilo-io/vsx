### Workflows

There are a variety of [different workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) to use with git, each for a purpose:

- Centralized Workflow
- Feature Branch Workflow
- Gitflow Workflow
- Forking Workflow

### Managing conflicts

You should be aware of how to manage merge conflicts. These usually occur when there were changes in your ****current_branch** (e.g. `feature/some-feature-name`) and the **target_branch** (e.g. `develop` or `master`).
