## Overview

React is a library responsible for the view layer of a web application. It can be combined with various other libraries to create a fully-fledged web application.
> NOTE: In contrast to a library, a framework such as [Angular]() is self-contained and opinionated. This means there is less thinking required on how to accomplish certain things in favour of ways which are predefined by the framework.

## Get Started

- [Create React App]

- [Custom webpack config]

## Principles

- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

Go over the [React Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) to understand how to manage state and lifecycle in function components.

Also make understand how these hooks work:

- must know: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef`
- secondary: `useLayoutEffect`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
