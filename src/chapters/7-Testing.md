## Unit Tests

UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.

### jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a unit testing library, which can be used to test individual bits of functionality in isolation.

## E2E Tests

E2E (end-to-end) tests help verify high-value paths in your application. In other words, they help verify user stories as they often represent flows in your application.

> NOTE:
> Sometimes associated/confused with `e2e` tests, `Integration` tests help verify the integration of multiple functions or components.

### Cypress

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing

## Visual Regression Testing
