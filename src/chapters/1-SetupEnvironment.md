## Env

- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> NOTE: Ideally install and manage Node via Homebrew:
>
> - `brew update`
> - `brew install node`
> - `node -v`
> - `npm -v`

And to install `yarn`:
> - `npm install -g yarn`
> - `yarn -v`

Depending on the project you will either use `npm` or `yarn` as the package manager.
> - NPM: locate a `package-lock.json` file in the project root.
> - YARN: locate a `yarn.lock` file in the project root.

> Reference: [Yarn vs NPM](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/npm-vs-yarn-which-should-you-choose/#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%20above,each%20one%20at%20a%20time.&text=While%20npm%20also%20supports%20the,Yarn%27s%20is%20far%20much%20better.)
